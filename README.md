easy explanation on github usage

# Here's a simplified guide to understanding GitHub:

Think of it as a virtual workspace: Just like how you have a physical desk to work on tasks, GitHub is like a digital desk where people work on computer code (instructions for computers).

Storing Projects: Imagine if you're working on a big puzzle. GitHub is like a special box where you can keep your puzzle pieces safe and organized. Except instead of puzzle pieces, it stores computer code.

Keeping Track of Changes: When many people are working on the same puzzle, it's essential to keep track of who's doing what. GitHub helps with this by keeping a record of all the changes made to the puzzle pieces (code) over time.

Collaboration: Just like how you might invite your friends over to help with your puzzle, GitHub allows multiple people to work together on the same project. Everyone can see what others are doing and contribute their own pieces.

Sharing and Feedback: Once your puzzle is complete, you might want to show it off to others or ask for feedback. GitHub lets you share your finished projects with others and receive comments and suggestions from the community.

So, in simple terms, GitHub is like a digital workspace where people store, work on, and collaborate on projects, particularly computer code.

#Deeper terminology dive (still somewhat easy though)

Repositories: Think of a repository (or "repo" for short) as a folder for your project. It's where you keep all your files, like the pieces of your puzzle. Each project on GitHub typically has its own repository. Just like you might have separate folders for different types of documents on your computer (like one for photos, one for music, etc.), GitHub repositories organize different parts of your project.

Commits: When you make changes to your project, like adding new puzzle pieces or adjusting existing ones, you create a "commit." This is like taking a snapshot of your puzzle at that moment. Commits help you keep track of what changes were made, when they were made, and who made them. It's a bit like saving different versions of a document as you work on it.

Branches: Imagine you're working on a puzzle with a friend, but you want to try out a different approach without messing up the main puzzle. You might decide to create a separate area to work on your ideas. In GitHub, this is called a "branch." It's a way to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main project until you're ready to merge your changes in.

Pull Requests (PRs): When you've finished working on your puzzle pieces in your branch and want to add them to the main puzzle, you create a pull request. This is like asking your friend to review your changes and decide if they should be added to the main puzzle. Pull requests are a way to discuss and review changes before they're merged into the main project. It's a collaborative process where others can provide feedback, suggest improvements, and make sure everything fits together smoothly.

Issues: Sometimes, while working on your puzzle, you might run into problems or have ideas for improvements. In GitHub, these are called "issues." They're like sticky notes you attach to your puzzle to remind yourself or others about things that need attention. Issues can be used to track bugs, suggest new features, or discuss any aspect of the project.

So, in summary, GitHub revolves around repositories (folders for projects), commits (snapshots of changes), branches (separate areas for experimenting), pull requests (requests to add changes), and issues (notes about problems or ideas). It's a collaborative platform that helps developers work together efficiently on software projects.
